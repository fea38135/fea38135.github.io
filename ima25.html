  <a href="videos/transpressor_change_sol2.mp4">Video 2</a> shows a motion between the same configurations as before, only that the fifth axis moves in the other direction. This avoids a self-intersection. The estimate does not hold anymore, as s<sub>5</sub> changes sign, but computing the Jacobian Determinant reveals that the motion still is nonsingular.
